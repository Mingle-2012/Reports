\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a reimagined version of the MapReduce framework tailored for distributed in-memory computing. Our proposed framework leverages memory as the primary storage medium for intermediate data, enabling faster execution while maintaining the core principles of MapReduce. Through careful design, we addressed key challenges such as efficient memory management, data partitioning,
 and fault tolerance in an in-memory context. Our source code and documentation are available at GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/llipengda/simple-mapreduce}}.
