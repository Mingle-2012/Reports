\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a reimplemented version of the MapReduce framework for distributed cloud computing. Our implemented framework provides a simplified yet efficient and comprehensive implementation of the MapReduce framework, adapting its core principles. Besides, our framework is designed to achieve several objectives, offering multiple features, including MapReduce Interfaces, Communication Framework, and Heartbeat Mechanism. Also, we describe the design and implementation comprehensively of our framework. The experimental results prove the correctness and efficiency of our implementation, showcasing the framework's ability to process large-scale datasets with high performance. Our source code and documentation are available at GitHub, as we describe in the conclusion.
