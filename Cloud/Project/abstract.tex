    As one of the foundational frameworks for processing large-scale datasets across distributed systems, MapReduce has demonstrated significant success in traditional distributed computing environments. Although MapReduce has been widely adopted and extended by various emerging systems and frameworks, its core principles have remained largely unchanged, offering valuable insights into the design of modern distributed cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a simplified yet efficient and comprehensive implementation of the MapReduce framework, adapting its core principles for in-memory operations. Our implementation adheres to the original MapReduce model while demonstrating its flexibility through several typical test cases. We provide a detailed overview of the framework's architecture and functionality, followed by an efficient implementation designed to address real-world computational problems. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments, evaluating the performance of our framework across multiple test scenarios. The results confirm the correctness and efficiency of the implementation, showcasing significant performance improvements compared to traditional disk-based methods.
