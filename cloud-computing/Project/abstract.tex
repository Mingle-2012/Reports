    As one of the foundational frameworks for processing large-scale datasets across distributed systems, MapReduce has demonstrated significant success in traditional distributed computing environments. Although MapReduce has been widely adopted and extended by various emerging systems and frameworks, its core principles have remained largely unchanged, offering valuable insights into the design of modern distributed cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a simplified yet efficient and comprehensive implementation of the MapReduce framework, adapting its core principles for map and reduce operations. Specifically, we first provide a detailed overview of the framework's architecture, comprehensively describing the design and implementation of the master and worker nodes. We then present the details of our implemented MapReduce framework, including the design objectives, system architecture, and core components, which is designed to be simple and easy to understand. To validate our implementation, we conduct several experiments, evaluating the performance of our framework across multiple datasets. The results prove the correctness and efficiency of our implementation, showcasing the framework's ability to process large-scale datasets with high performance. Our source code and documentation are available at GitHub, as we describe in the conclusion.
